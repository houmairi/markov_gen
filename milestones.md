# Markov Chain Text Generator Project Plan

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and Data Structures
- [y] Set up C++ project and version control (e.g., Git)
- [ ] Implement basic data structures:
  - [ ] Create a `MarkovChain` class
  - [ ] Implement a map to store state transitions
- [ ] Write functions to read and preprocess input text

## Milestone 2: Core Markov Chain Algorithm
- [ ] Implement function to build Markov chain from input text
- [ ] Create function to generate next word based on current state
- [ ] Develop main text generation function

## Milestone 3: Text Generation and Output
- [ ] Implement seed text handling for generation start
- [ ] Create function to generate a complete text of specified length
- [ ] Add output formatting and display

## Milestone 4: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Develop unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Test with various input texts and parameters
- [ ] Refine algorithm based on test results

## Milestone 5: Enhancements and Optimization (optional)
- [ ] Implement n-gram support for improved text quality
- [ ] Add command-line interface for user input
- [ ] Optimize performance for larger input texts

## Milestone 6: Documentation and Finalization
- [ ] Write comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Document code with clear comments
- [ ] Prepare sample input texts and example outputs
